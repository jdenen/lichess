* Lichess
Small app with CLI tasks for tracking Lichess progress (or lack thereof).

** Usage
*** Chart
Run this command in your terminal, where =$variant= is a game type or speed (like =rapid= or =chess960=).

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :var variant="blitz" :var user="beardedjohnson" :eval yes :results output code
mix chart.$variant $user
#+END_SRC

*** Recap
Run this command in your terminal to see a recap of a =$user='s last 100 games.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :var user="beardedjohnson" :eval yes :results output raw :wrap src txt
mix recap $user
#+END_SRC

** Setup
Run in your terminal or execute this code block in Emacs:

#+NAME: setup
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval query :results silent
mix do deps.get, compile
#+END_SRC

A =LICHESS_API_TOKEN= environment variable /must/ be set at compile time.

I suggest using [[https://direnv.net/][direnv]] to set your =LICHESS_API_TOKEN= in this project only. The root =.envrc= file is ignored, so there's no risk of committing your token.
